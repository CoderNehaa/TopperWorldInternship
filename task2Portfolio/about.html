                👋 Hello there! I'm Neha Nagda, currently working as Content Reviewer at Tech Firefly and I'm passionate about the tech and coding world. My journey in the world of programming started when I started learning coding by enrolling into a Coding Ninjas’ Career Camp Full Stack Web-development batch.
                💻 Currently, I'm honing my skills as an aspiring software developer, with a focus on front-end technologies. I enjoy creating captivating user interfaces and delightful web experiences. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I'm diving into popular frameworks like React.            
                📚 I believe in the power of continuous learning, and I'm always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge. 
                <br/><br/>

                🎓 I'm a under-graduate student in Bio-science at MG College, MLSU, Udaipur. 🚀 In my free time, you can find me building personal projects, or tinkering with side projects to sharpen my skills. When I'm not coding, I enjoy novels and music.
                <br/><br/>

                🤝 I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals, mentors, and potential collaborators.
